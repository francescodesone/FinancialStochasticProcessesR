# ðŸ“ˆ FinancialStochasticProcessesR

**FinancialStochasticProcessR** is an R package designed to simulate and visualize a variety of **stochastic processes** commonly used in finance, econometrics, and time-series modeling.

The package provides flexible tools to generate, analyze, and plot random processes driven by different probability distributions â€” including normal, Studentâ€™s *t*, generalized error, and skewed distributions.
